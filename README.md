# Next.js App Router Course - Starter

I learn Next.JS by creating this app which is provided by Next.js Team, Vercel.

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

## Root Folder and File System Routing

The Root folder is app folder known as the root folder which contains two main files "page.tsx" and "layout.tsx".

### Nesting route 

To create a nested route, folders can be nested inside each other and add page.tsx files inside them.
Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment.
Each Route using layout.tsx and page.tsx files to create seperate UIs.

### Page.tsx

page.tsx file is a special Next.js file that exports a React Component, and it required for the route to be accessible 

### Layout.tsx

layout.tsx file is to create UI that share between multiple pages.
