## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

I learn Next.JS by creating this app which is provided by Next.js Team, Vercel.

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

Inside the "app" folder, there are two main files which are "page.tsx" and "layout.tsx".
